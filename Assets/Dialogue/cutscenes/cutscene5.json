Are the legends true?","\n","^???: Are you truly here to free the ball pit from the grasps of the 3 factions?","\n","^Atlas: huh? No? I don’t care about the factions. I just want to find my sister and get out of here.","\n","^???: the butterfly girl is your sister?","\n","^Atlas: I believe so. Everything I learn about her seems to line up with my sister so I must find her.","\n","^???: why do you care so much about your sister?","\n","^???: Wouldn’t you rather just join a faction and have some fun rather than looking for her?","\n","^Atlas: I dunno. I don’t really care about most of that stuff?","\n","^Atlas: To be honest I don’t really care that much about my sister, she’s annoying, she’s so dumb and illogical,","\n","^Atlas: always getting way too into things and taking things way too far.","\n","^Atlas: But she’s family, so I have to, at all costs I guess.","\n","^???: that’s admirable, looking for something at all costs,","\n","^???: ignoring all possible distractions in the name of one goal,","\n","^???: even if said goal involves an annoying opstical that will keep making everything harder for you.","\n","^???: I can relate. You know, I once had something I would give up everything for.","\n","^???: Give up my position, give up my people for. But it was taken from me.","\n","^???: So I built this place, built this faction from the ground up so that I can some day use my power to find it.","\n","^???: I also don’t care for the ball pit or the factions. Only the power they can grant me","\n","^Atlas: you built this place from the ground up? That doesn’t seem very feasible?","\n","^???: yes, it isn’t, but metaphorical building sounds so much more poetic no.","\n","^Atlas: I guess so?","\n","^???: you know, I like you. You’re both determined and smart.","\n","^???: If you ever grow beyond the ties of your family, you have a place in my faction.","\n","^Atlas: your faction?","\n","^???: yes! I am Queen Dragonleaf! Leader of the great tunnels!","\n","^Queen Dragonleaf: And if you ever decide that there’s more important things than saving your sister?","\n","^Queen Dragonleaf: You will be more than welcome here.","\n","^Atlas: thanks I guess?","\n","^Queen Dragonleaf: you’re welcome!","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
